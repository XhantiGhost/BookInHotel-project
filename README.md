# CREATE A HOTEL BOOKING FORM 
## **You need to create a hotel booking form, using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and a little bit of JS.

**The form must have frontend validation using HTML and PHP, and should contain the following:

*First name: [required]
*Surname: [required]
*Number of nights: [required and greater than 0]
*Hotel: [dropdown menu]

You should have at least 3 different hotels to choose from. Each hotel must have a different daily rate. This daily rate should be displayed when the hotel is selected. It should also be used to calculate the total cost. Once a booking has been made, a message should be displayed confirming the booking.

*Eg
Hello [name]. You are booking The [hotel name].
Number of nights: 3
Daily rate: R350
Total: R1050.00

##**All user responses should be captured in a MySQL database. When a booking is submitted, you must use PHP validation to check for duplicates. If a duplicate is found, a message should be displayed notifying the user.

*Eg
Hello [name]. Our records show that you have already made this booking.

##Tools to be used:

* **HTML
* **CSS
* **PHP
* **MySQL
* **A bit of JS
* **Bootstrap / Bulma
